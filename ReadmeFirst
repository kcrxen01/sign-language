im using python 3.10

install these pips:

pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe==0.10.11
pip install tensorflow==2.10
pip install cvzone

im using a local host database here to store the login and registration.

note: if it does not work try to open your virtual environment (.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1). 
Your terminal will look like this "(venv) PS C:\Users\USER\Hand detector>". 
If it still does not work, please refer to other online resources to address your concerns. Thank you
